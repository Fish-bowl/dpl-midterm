started light work at around 6 on friday 
-------friday--------
created beer component 
added it to app render
added it to nav bar 
stopped at around 7 for dinner 
------saturday-------
started around 3:30 at a coffeeshpop
got beers to actually appear (rapper status)
styled beer cards 
...
added locations ,and breweries 
refactored them for importing for better styling 
ended around 7 with some fun logic errors ( need to get main page to show all requests not just one )


-------sunday--------
started work at 5
started work on the main page
left at 6 for more errands 
back to work at 7:30
been working on pagination for way to long 
getting errors that are either from me importing wrong and using state/store wrong or some other shit...getting this error for all semantic ui usage 
⇩⬇︎☟
./src/components/Pagination.js
8:29-39 'semantic-ui-react' does not contain an export named 'Pagination'.

which is odd because im folowing semantic exactly, and the pagination docs link leads to an unfortunate 404 so I suppose I'm s.o.l on that one. can't get it going for the life of me so I shall continue to style what I have and maybe it will strike me like lightining
worked on this same error until 11:00 to no avail.. can't wait to see what I did
-----
a lil embarrased. its now late and I'm sleep ready. but I just realized how much info the location request gets back... i coult have put this whole app onto one card group... 
did horridly on the project for the most part imho but I feel like I learned a lot from this assignment......
mainly --- dig around in dev tools and console befor you actually build 

--------todo--------
12) pagination
13) refactor styles into one component 

sad unfinished friends ^^
